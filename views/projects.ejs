            <p>Instagram is such a useful tool to interact with consumers and to 
                promote new products. Something I have learned is taking into account the 
                company's aesthetic in order to keep a identifiable theme across their brand.
                One cohesive voice, posting schedule, and appearance to your social media accounts 
                keeps a recognizable brand for customers.

                        I find that it is important to list out the specific features of

                    <p>Utilizing Instagram stories is valuable to reach your audience with anything ranging 
                        from updates with your brand, new posts, and even events. It is quick, simple and effective. 
                        I created some examples of potential Instagram stories using the clothing brand Reformation as 
                        an example.

                            clothing to attract customers to update their wardrobe for the colder weather. 
                            Their audience may not be aware of all of the new clothing so this story gives them a taste of 
                            the cute new pieces for the season. Using stories, they are able to announce the update on their 
                            website and even put out a link for people to click on and shop. Stories are quick, simple, and
                            effective when trying to spread a message to your socials.

                            you have a new post. I have found that a lot of people will religiously view stories instead of their feed.
                            Posting stories can bring the audience's attention to your new post if they have not seen it. 
                            I have seen many accounts promote their new posts by simply just reposting it to their story 
                            with a plain background. Take your account to the next level by creating unique and eyecatching 
                            story posts.

                            mission. Every year, Reformation takes the time to write up a sustainability report in order to 
                            show their impact on the environment. The purpose of this story is to one, show that 
                            Reformation cares about their carbon footprint and two, give their followers a clickable link 
                            to check out the report for 2022. This is an easy way to share links to Instagram rather than 
                            relying on people to click on the link in your bio.
