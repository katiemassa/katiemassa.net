            <p>Instagram is such a useful tool to interact with consumers and to 
                promote new products. Something I have learned is taking into account the 
                company's aesthetic in order to keep a identifiable theme across their brand.
                One cohesive voice, posting schedule, and appearance to your social media accounts 
                keeps a recognizable brand for customers.

                        I find that it is important to list out the specific features of
